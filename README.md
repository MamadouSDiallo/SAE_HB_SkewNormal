# Unit Level Small Area Estimation (SAE) - HB

A library of functions to estimate model parameters and make predictions under a unit-level small area estimation (SAE) model with skew-normal errors. This is a Bayesian approach i.e. random priors are assigned to the parameters as oppose to an Empirical approach where the parameters are estimated using the frequentist paradigm.
